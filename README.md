# 1000 Problems

Note: 1000 is not a hard hit number, believe me this can be extended further.

Goal of this project is to collect a good 1000 problems that improve programming
or analytical ability of a person. A person doesn't have to search across web or any
coding platforms for this kind of problems, this would be a single destination for coding
problem search.

# Contributing

Anyone can submit a pull requestfor a problem, We believe nolicence is the best thing for this,
 It's just that please follow the below guidelines.

# Guidelines

###1. Better be organized.

   Problems has been divided into multiple buckets, it's better to group similar problems
   together.

   So, the directory structure has been designed in a way that similar problems stay in the same directory.

   We assume this hold 1000 problmes, we are allocating few numbers for each type of problem, Be it an Array/Linked List/Binary Tree/Sorting/Graphs/Dynamicprogramming.....so on.

   We started with `Array's` and `Binary tree's` in the beginning, allotted first 200 slots for Array problems and 200 to 300 for `Binary Tree` problems.

   With in `Array` allotted foirst 150, we can further divide into sub categories of each 50 size, so `Array` related problems contains total 3 directories `a_50`, `b_100`, `c_150`.

   This is just a way to better organize the similar problems, this can be modified if there is better solution.

###2. Follow coding standards of language specific.

   We are not bounded to one single language here, Any laguage is fine to solve the problem. But, make sure the coding standars of a language followed. We'll try to automate this futher.

###3. Choosing problems.

   Choose the better problems, we can't say which problem is better. But, it doesn't make any sense to add
   a simple problem like `Given array [1, 3, 4, 2, 6], find sum of all the numbers.`

   It's just that a problem should have some logic hidden to solve.

### Problems Table.

|Number|ProblemType|
|---|---|
|a_50|array|
|b_100|array|
|c_150|linked list|
|d_200|binary tree|
|e_250|binary search|
