Given input an array[] of n integers, output a newArray of n integers such that
newArra[i] is equal to product of all the other elements in the array except the array[i].

solve this with using division and without using division.

Example:
   input = [1, 3, 4, 6, 2]
   output_raw = [3*4*6*2, 1*4*6*2, 1*3*6*2, 1*3*4*2, 1*3*4*6] == [144, 48, 36, 24, 72]
